# Review Section Drafting Figure Picking

Goal: write each section as a separate file, with figures tied to paragraphs.

## Inputs

```text
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/selected_outline.md
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/literature_matrix.json
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/section_blueprint.json
review-projects/<project_id>/01_matrix_outline/section_writing_plan.md
<review_root>/skills/review-section-blueprint/references/rule_packs.json
<review_root>/template/综述模板写作方式与风格总结.md
```

For every assigned paper, reopen:

```text
metadata JSON
linked Markdown
PDF when checking figures/schemes/tables
```

## Writing Rules

```text
Write by section.
Each section outputs one independent Markdown file.
Use one subagent per section when parallel execution is available.
Each paragraph normally corresponds to one paper's work.
Each paragraph must have one figure/scheme/table tied to that paper.
If no useful figure exists, write an explicit no_figure_reason.
Use the literature matrix main_content as the starting evidence, but verify against Markdown/PDF.
Do not write short examples; write complete review prose.
```

Follow the template review paragraph mode:

```text
1. introduce why this paper/method matters in the section
2. describe the paper's main transformation or principle
3. attach the corresponding scheme/figure/table
4. explain what the scheme shows: substrate, product, catalyst, selectivity, mechanism, or limitation
5. close with a review-level judgment or transition
```

Each paragraph must carry a stable `paragraph_id` and explicit citation IDs.
This is the anchor the merge stage uses to bind figures and aggregate citations.

```text
paragraph_id           e.g. sec3-p2, unique inside section_drafts.json
paper_id               primary paper for that paragraph
cited_paper_ids        list of every paper_id the paragraph relies on
claim or topic sentence
main work of the paper
why it matters to the review topic
figure reference or no_figure_reason
inline citation callout `[n]` keyed to the section reference list
```

## Paragraph ID Markers

Every paragraph in `sections/<section_id>.md` must end with an HTML comment
that exposes its `paragraph_id`, for example:

```markdown
... last sentence of the paragraph. [3]

<!-- paragraph_id: sec3-p2 -->
```

The merge stage uses these markers (not free-text matching) to anchor
figures. Missing markers will silently fall back to heading-level placement.

## Hard Output Requirements

Every section Markdown file must satisfy all of:

```text
at least one image reference using ![](...) when figure_need is not explicitly "none"
every paragraph that cites a paper carries an inline `[n]` callout
the section file ends with (or is accompanied by) a numbered reference list
  so that downstream merge can collect callouts and assemble the global
  References section.
```

Without these the merge stage will produce a draft that fails the final
audit's hard gate (`draft_has_no_figures`,
`draft_has_no_citation_callouts`, `missing_references_section`).

## Figure Rules

Before writing, run:

```bash
python <review_root>/skills/review-section-drafting-figure-picking/scripts/build_paper_figure_inventory.py \
  --review-root <review_root> \
  --project-id <project_id>
```

Use real source figures/schemes/tables from MinerU/PDF. Do not invent figures.

## Outputs

Write under:

```text
review-projects/<project_id>/02_section_drafting/
```

Required files:

```text
section_tasks.json
sections/<section_id>.md
section_drafts.json
section_drafts.md
paper_figure_inventory.json
paper_figure_candidates.json
figure_candidates.json
section_drafting_report.md
```

`section_drafts.json` must contain, for every section, a `paragraphs` list. Each paragraph item carries `paragraph_id`, `paper_id`, `cited_paper_ids`, and (when applicable) `figure_candidate_id`. The aggregated `draft_md` is still kept for preview.

`figure_candidates.json` items must carry `target_paragraph_id` (the paragraph_id this figure should attach to). Free-text `fits_paragraph_or_claim` stays optional and human-readable.

`section_tasks.json` must be a list. Each item must contain:

```text
section_id
heading
core_argument
allowed_papers
must_cover_points
avoid_points
figure_need
```

Use `section_blueprint.json.sections[].major_papers` as the source for `allowed_papers`.

`sections/<section_id>.md` is mandatory for every section. `section_drafts.md` concatenates the section files for preview only.

Stop after this stage for human check.
